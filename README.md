### Hi everyone, I'm Keivan Amini ðŸ‘‹

## About me ðŸ˜„
I'm a 24 years old italian guy with a MSc in **Applied Physics** at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it), currently working on statistical methods and ML applied to health domain. Recently, I have been a Research Intern at the [Institut des SystÃ¨mes Intelligents et de Robotique](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/isir/presentation/?lang=en) in Paris, where I have been part of the project [**ELSA**](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/projects/elsa/?lang=en), to study social affrodances between robot-human interaction through reinforcement-learning ðŸ¤–

In my free time I work as a **Digital Educator** in many different school of Ferrara and in [Laboratorio Aperto di Ferrara](https://laboratorioapertoferrara.it/), conducting robotics and coding laboratory adressed to kids.

In general, I am a curious person who enjoys immersing myself in numerous projects, even those that are vastly different from one another. For a complete list of adventures, check my [CV](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/keivan.amini2/download/en/Keivan_Amini_CV-ENG.pdf)!
