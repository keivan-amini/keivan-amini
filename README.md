### Hi everyone, I'm Keivan Amini ðŸ‘‹

## About me ðŸ˜„
I'm a 24 years old italian guy, working as Research Engineer at the [Department of Physics](https://physics-astronomy.unibo.it/en) at the University of Bologna. At the moment, I am working on statistical methods, network theory and machine learning applied to health domain!

## Background ðŸ“š
I have a MSc in **Applied Physics** at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it) and a BSc in **Physics** at the [University of Ferrara](https://www.unife.it/it). Recently, I have been a Research Intern at the [Institut des SystÃ¨mes Intelligents et de Robotique](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/isir/presentation/?lang=en) in Paris, where I have been part of the project [ELSA](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/projects/elsa/?lang=en), to study social affrodances in human-robot interaction through reinforcement learning ðŸ¤–

In my free time I work as a **Digital Educator** in many different school of Ferrara and in [Laboratorio Aperto di Ferrara](https://laboratorioapertoferrara.it/), conducting robotics and coding laboratory adressed to kids.

For a complete list of adventures, check my [CV](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/keivan.amini2/download/en/CV_Keivan_Amini.pdf)!

## Interests ðŸ§ 
My interests lie at the crossroads of *mathematical modeling*, *multidisciplinary research*, and *machine learning*.

As a physicist, I love to derive and exploit mathematical models to describe different kind of processes, ranging from the diffusion on graphs to the dynamics of a swarm of robots. Moreover, I firmly believe that addressing complex challenges for the society (e.g., climate change) requires embracing multidisciplinary approaches, which will be every day more useful for the society. In addition, the rapid advancements in machine learning make it an incredibly exciting field to be a part of!

In summary, I am a naturally curious individual who enjoys immersing in diverse projects, each offering unique learning opportunities ðŸŒ±
