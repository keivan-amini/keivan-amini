### Hi everyone, I'm Keivan Amini ðŸ‘‹

## About me ðŸ˜„
I'm a 22 years old italian guy with a bachelor in **Physics** at the [University of Ferrara](https://www.unife.it/it), and currently pursuing the master's degree in **Applied Physics** at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). In my free time I work as a **Digital Educator** in many different school of Ferrara and in [Laboratorio Aperto di Ferrara](https://laboratorioapertoferrara.it/), conducting robotics and coding laborarory adressed to kids.

From January to June 2023 I will make an internship at the [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) in the [Institut des SystÃ¨mes Intelligents et de Robotique](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/isir/presentation/?lang=en), in Paris, in order to write my master's thesis. In particular, I will be part of the project **ELSA**, to study social affrodances between robot-human interaction through a reinforcement-learning approach. More informations about the project [here](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/projects/elsa/?lang=en).

So I definetely thought it might be a good idea to get confortable with the git environment and improve my coding skills ðŸ’ª
